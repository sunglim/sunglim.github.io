Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 19

# Chapter 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

너무 쉽거나 너무 어려운걸 하면 금방 지루해지고 안하게 된다. 적절히 난의도를 높여서 도전하게되면 동기부여도되고 흥미를 잃지않을수 있다.

지루함(Boredom)은 누구에게나 오는것이다. 프로와 아마추어의 차이점은 이를 어떻게 극복하고 꾸준히 하냐의 차이다.

All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn't feel like much.
Things are going well. It's easy to rationalize taking a day off because you're in a good place.

* The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.

* The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.

* Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It's the ability to keep going when work isn't exciting that make the difference.

* Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.
