Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 7
Chapter 6. Motivation Is Overrated; Environment often Matters More
* Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
* Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context becomes the cue.
* It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.
* Create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is "one space, one use"
