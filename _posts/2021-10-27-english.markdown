Day 2

Chapter 1. The Surpising Power of Atomic Habits

If we make a small change a day for one year, it would be a huge impact. A small outcome in a short term doesn't matter. What matter is whether my habits are putting myself on the right track towarding success.

An atomic habit is a little habit that is part of a large system. atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

If you want better results, then forget about setting golas. Focus on your system instead.

What I learned today:

I often get frustrated whenever I don't see any progress, and stopped building new habits. Now I know the breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions. Focusing on system is way better, practical, and achievable method to build habits.

You do not rise(raise= 일으키다) to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.
