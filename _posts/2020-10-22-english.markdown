Yesterday I visited Linked in 4 or 5 years. and I checked how my Linkedin friends are doing.



And those Linkedin friends reminded me the old days I was a some sort of internet troll.  At that time, I just jumped in any opensource projects that seemed interesting, and asked question, requested code review, wrote anything in online community with my bad English.
