Having small talks -

Yesterday my English teacher asked me if I often have small talks. 
Unlikely American people, most Asians dont have a tendency to have small talk - especially with strangers. 

Looking back, when strangers are too friendly to me, I would think this guy may want me to buy something, or this guy may be going to ask me to do something.
