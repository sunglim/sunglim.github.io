(I usually first google 'book name + github + ebook'. Developers loves books, they upload PDF or epub version on github)

Recently, one of my coworkers recommended that I read a book, 'Atomic Habits'. It is one of best sellers in Amazon. As of today, it ranked at #7.

The book is written by James Clear who is a speaker focused on habits, decision making, and continous improvement.

The subtitle of this book is 'An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones'. I have been struggling to build new good habits and had difficulties to break bad ones like playing games, this book is obviously essential for me.

This book is composed of twenty chapters, and each chapter has approximately twenty pages. Today I read only the first chapter, and felt that I should build a new habit(Reading English books) by reading this 'atomic habits'. So, I decided to read one chapter a day, summarize it, and post it on my instagram.
