Recently, one of my coworks recommended that I read a book, 'Atomic Habits'.

The book is written by James Clear who is a speaker focusedon habits, decision making, and continous improvement.

The subtitle of this book is 'An easy & proven way to build good habits & break bad ones'. As I am person who have been struggling to build new good habits and had difficulties to break bad ones like playing games, this book is obviously essential for me.

This book is composed of twenty chapters, and each chapter has approximately twenty pages. Today I read only the first chapter, and felt that I should build a new habit(Reading English books) by reading this 'atomic habits'. So, I decided to read one chapter a day, summarize it, and post it on my instagram.
