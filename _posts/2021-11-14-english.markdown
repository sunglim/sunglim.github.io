# Chapter 17. How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

Habit contract - bad habit을 하면 벌금을 내는 방식으로 나쁜 습관을 고칠수 있다.

내 행동에 대해 immediate pain을 주면 안하게 된다.

* We are less likely to repeat a bad habit if it is painful or unsatisfying.

* An accountability partner can create an immediate cost to inaction. We care deeply about what others think of us, and we do not want others to have a lesser opinion of us.

* Knowing that someone else is watching you can be a powerful motivator.
