# Ch5. How to Lead a Team

## The Tech Lead

The tech lead (TL) of a team—who will often report to the manager of that team—is
responsible for (surprise!) the technical aspects of the product, including technology
decisions and choices, architecture, priorities, velocity, and general project manage‐
ment (although on larger teams they might have program managers helping out with
    this). The TL will usually work hand in hand with the engineering manager to ensure
that the team is adequately staffed for their product and that engineers are set to work
on tasks that best match their skill sets and skill levels. Most TLs are also individual
contributors, which often forces them to choose between doing something quickly
themselves or delegating it to a team member to do (sometimes) more slowly. The
latter is most often the correct decision for the TL as they grow the size and capability
of their team.

## Antipattern: Hire Pushovers

You should strive to hire people who are smarter than you.

## Antipattern: Ignore low performers

The benefit of dealing with a low performer as quickly as possible is that you can put
yourself in the position of helping them up or out.

## Antipattern: Treat your team like children

If I treat team members like kinds - people tend to act the way I treat them.
