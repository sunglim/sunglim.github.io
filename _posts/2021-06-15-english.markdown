# Chapter 5. Information Hiding (and Leakage)

Discussing techniques for creating deep modules.

## 5.1 Information hiding

The most important technique for achieving deep module. The basic idea is that each module should encapsulated a few piece of knowledge. The knowledge is embedded in the module's implementation but does not appear in its interface.

The information hidden usually consists of detilas about how to implement some mechanism.

> 어떻게 구현햇냐에 대한것은 숨긴다

Usually - hidden information includes 'data structures' and 'algorithms', 'low level details'

Information hiding reduces complexity in two ways. - hides details. abstract view of the module's functionality. -> Reduces the congnitive load

For example, a developer doens't needs to worry about how b-tree implemented.

Second, information hiding makes it easier to evolve the system.  -> If a piece of infmration is hidden. there are no dependencies on the information outisde the module containing the information. -> 모듈화가 되어있다는 뜻

## 5.2 Information leakage

The opposite of information hiding is information leakage. This creates a dependency between the modules. -> 하나의 모듈이 바뀌었지만 여러가지 모듈이 같이 바껴야하는경우

Information leakage is one of the most important red flags in software design.

정의에 따르면 interface를 통해 정보가 공유되는것도 information leakage다. 그래서 simpler interfaces를 하는게 좋다.

if you encounter information leakage between classes, ask yourself "how can I reorganize these classes so that this particular piece of knowledge only affects a single class?" If the affected classes are relatively small and closely tied to the leaked information, it may make sense to merge them into a single class.
-> 영향받는 두 클레스가 작은 사이즈라면, 클레스를 합치는것.

or pull the information out of all of the affected classes and create a new class that encapsulates just that information. 
-> 공통된 정보를 빼내서 클래스를 따로 만드는것. 그 새로만든 인터페이스가 간단하고 encapsulate할수있어야한다.

## 5.3 Temporal decomposition(시간적 분해)

Temporal decomposition is one common cause of information leakage. In temporal decomposition, the structure of a system corresponds to the time order in which operation will occur.

> 시간순서대로 시스템 구조가 만들어져있다.

For example, reads a file, modifies the contents of the file, and then writes the file out again. With temporal decomposition, this applicaiton might be broken into three classes: read, modifiy, write.

The solution is to combine the core mechanism for reading and writing files into a single class.

> 읽기 쓰기를 하나의 클래스로 만든다.

It's easy to fall into the trap of temporal decomposition, because the order in which operations must occur is often on your mind when you code. However, most design decisions manifest htemselves at several different times over the life of the application.

> 시간순서대로 클래스를 만들지만 실제로는 어플리케이션 동작동안 여러번 나타난다.

Order usually does matter, so it will be reflected somewhere in the application. However, it shouldn't be reflected in the module structure unless that struct is consistent with information hiding.

*When designing module, focus on the knowledge that's needed to perform each task, not the order in wwhich tasks occur.*

## 5.4 Eaample: HTTP server
## 5.5 Example: too many classes



# Chapter 10. Define Erros Out Of Existence

Developers often define exceptions wwithout considering how they will be handled.

The key is to reduce the number of places where xceptions must be handled; in many cases the semantics of operations can be modified so that the normal behavior handles all situations and here is no exceptional conditions to report.

구현을 수정함으로써 일반적인 처리루틴으로 예외적인 상황을 줄일수있다.

## 10.1 Why exceptions add complexity

Exception - any uncommon condition that alter the normal flow of control in a program.

Exceptions can occur even without using a formal exception reporting mechanism, such as when a method returns a special valuue indiciating that it didn't complete its normal behavior.
