I would always prefer obvious code over short code.

+1. Short is nice insofar as it lets you fit more of the code in your head at once, but clarity is the goal. I'm fairly unconvinced that just having a (D)CHECK that something didn't fail (if we believe it cannot) or a conditional statement (if we believe it might) isn't the right solution. That's what we do nearly everywhere else.
