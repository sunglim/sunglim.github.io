Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 8

Chapter 7. The Secret to Self-Control

요약: Self-control의 비밀은 나의 행동을 유발하는 것들을 제거 하라는것.

예를들어 페이스북을 너무 많이 한다면 핸드폰이나 컴퓨터를 멀리한다.

Here's the punch line: You can break a habit, but you're unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely - even if they go unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits in a negative environment.

A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

나를 유혹하는 것들을 옆에 두고 하지않기는 힘들다. 아예 그 자리를 피하는것이 현명하다. in a short term, self-control을 할수있겠지만 장기적으로는 차근차근 환경을 바꿔나가야한다.
