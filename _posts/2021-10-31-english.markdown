Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 5

Chapter 4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right

* With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically, your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. -> Can be trained.

* Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.

* The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.

* The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we've done somethinga thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. - We assume that the next time will be just like the last. 

* Challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. We need a "point-and-call" system, a Habits Scorecard.

* The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior.
