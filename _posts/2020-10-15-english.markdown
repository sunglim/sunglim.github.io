So far in my life, I've struggled to learn new things. It was mostly technical stuff.

What would be my next journey? I want something very very difficult to archive. technical things are somewhat realistic, but it's boring.
What about learning investment. I've already done it.

# 日本語

Learning Japanese is my next journey. Learning language is generally thought one of most difficult thing. and it's almost impossible to be fluently such as native.
