Recently I decided to create a website to help my stock trading.

The website would have

- Currency
- Bitcoin price
- KOSPI, S&P 500 index, Dow, and Nasdaq index

Above values are that I keep watching every day.


1. Batch script running daily.
  - Use Google Clound Function(https://cloud.google.com/functions/)
  - Google clound Trial project is free.

2. Database
 - Instead of using realtime database like MS SQL. I decided to use google sheet
   as a database. Google sheeet provide a bunch of API that I can easily use.

# Study Plan
  Google Clound Function(https://cloud.google.com/functions/)

# TODO
  Write a script to get data from google sheet. and use it on my blog.
