Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 13

Chapter 13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

습관을 만드는게 너무 어렵다. 그러면 딱 2분만 해보자. 운동을 딱 2분만해보자. 책을 딱 2분만 읽자

2분만하더라도 routine을만드는것이고 그것이 나의 identity를 만드는 것이다.

* Habits can be completed in a few seconds but continue to impact your behavior for minutes or hours afterward.

* The Two-Minute Rule state, "When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do."

* Standardize before you optimize. You can't improve a habit that doesn't exist.

As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine.
