Book review: Atomic Habits - Day 10

Chapter 9. The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

우리는 주위사람들 - 가족, 친구, 회사, 모임 - 의 영향을 많이 받고 그들을 따라하게 된다. 가까운 사람을 따라하게되고, 더 많은 사람의 행동을 따라하고, 더 힘있는 사람을 따라하게된다.

* We don't choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large.

* The close, The many, The powerful.

* One of the most effective things you cna do to build better habits is to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

* The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us.

* The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the indivisual. Most days, we'd rather be wrong with the crowd than be right by ourselves.
