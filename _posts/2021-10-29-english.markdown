Chapter 2. How Your Habits Shape Your identity (and Vice Versa)

* Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.
* The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better result, but because they can change your beliefs about yourself.

To change our habits, we should start by focusing on who we wish to become.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this.

Your behavior(habits) are usually a reflection of your identity.

2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.
