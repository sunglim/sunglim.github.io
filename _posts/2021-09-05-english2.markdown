# Investing in Happiness - Ben Felix

It is addtive to focus on portfolio optimizations the next big thing that promises financial gain or working long hours toward a promotion.

Calling it additive is not hyperbole. In a 2001 study using FMRI to measure brain activity ... found that obtaining more money activates the same regions of the brains as illicit drugs. Maybe that doesn't sounds so bad. More money is always better than less. 

Well, here's the problem. From your brain's perspective more money is always better than whatever you have today. Even if you already have a lot of money. Knowing that more money is additive an important question for every human investor to ask themselves is how much is enough.

I would ventrue to say that enough is the amount needed to fund a good life. But to fund a good life we need to know what a good life looks like.

Money has the unique ability to move economic value through time. Money made from work done today can be used to fund spending in the future. Time and money are both finite resources that we have to make allocation decision about on a daily basis.

There's no objectively optimal way to allocate time and money but I'm going to argue that the human investors these decisions should be anchored in the objective of living a good life. So we need to know how to find a good life.

Fortunately, there is a substational body of academic literature on this topic. A large portion of happiness seems to be heritable. Meaning that in sample populations, environmental factors fail to completely explain differences in happiness. Martin Seligman who's credited with starting the field of posivie psychology suggests a baisc equation for human happiness.

Happiness euqals your biological set point plus your circumstances. plus the factors under your voluntary control.
