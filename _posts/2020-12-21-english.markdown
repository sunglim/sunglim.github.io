## The human condition

_The Daily Show_ reported recently that the scientists in Japan had invented a robot that is capable of regonizing its own reflection in a mirror.

"When the robot learns to hate what it seees," said Jon Stewart, "it will have achieved full humanity"

## Habits

The difference between an amateur and a profession is in their habits.

We can never free ourselves from habits. The human being is a creature of habit.

But we can replace bad habits with good ones.

We can trade in the habits of the amateur and the addict for the practice of the professional and the committed artist or entrepreneur.

It may help, as a jumping-off place, to consider the interior world of the most passionate and tragic creature of habit -- the addict.
